# Memo

This project aims to create a simple memo app.

It is inspired by:
[mattn memo](https://github.com/mattn/memo)

The files used by default:
- The config file is stored in ~/.config/memo/conf
>> If you want a different path, then add an `env`	variable called $GMEMOCONF which has the full path of the new location.
